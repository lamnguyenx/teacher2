Portrait of Katharine Edgar, a woman wearing glasses and a dark blazer.

**Katharine Edgar** has 19 years of experience teaching mathematics to pupils across the whole ability range. Her vast experience in both the teaching of the curriculum and assessment of pupils' learning has led to an in-depth knowledge of the misconceptions that can be present in pupils' understanding of basic mathematical concepts. Katharine holds a degree in pure mathematics and a PGCE in mathematics education, and held a senior leadership post of assistant head teacher for many years.

Her expertise was recognised by an appointment in 2002 to the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), where she was entrusted to work on the development of assessment for the English National Curriculum in both the areas of mathematics and English. From 2002 to 2009, Katharine held various high profile roles within the QCA, in both the Assessment and Curriculum divisions. This included being a director of the National Assessment Agency, which is a subsidiary of QCA. As such, she is knowledgeable about the various primary curriculum reviews that have taken place in England in recent years. Katharine is a strong supporter of the Cambridge approach. She views the Cambridge Primary Programme as a sound foundation on which to build secure mathematical knowledge and understanding.

Katharine is currently an independent education consultant working with schools specialising in monitoring and quality assurance, and with the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) in England in the assessment of mathematics and English.

## Preface

What coins can Rita use to pay for the two erasers?

What coins can Ari use to pay for the notebook?

### I will learn to:

- Recognise all coins and know their values
- Count and work out how to pay an exact amount of money using coins
- Exchange coins of different values

### Values of coins

We can pay for things that we buy using coins. A **coin** has two sides — the front and the back.

Each coin has a different value. Look at these two coins.

## Capacity

One more trip to go and I am done!

I wonder how much longer I will take.

Who will make more trips to fetch water?

Why do you think so?

### I will learn to:

- Compare capacities of two or more containers
- Estimate and measure the capacities of containers

### Comparing capacities

#### Using describing words

![Five containers (A, B, C, D, E) placed on a table. A is full, B is nearly full, C is half full, D is nearly empty, and E is empty.](92559ed2a425c10fbf2979d6da88909b_img.jpg)

Five containers (A, B, C, D, E) placed on a table. A is full, B is nearly full, C is half full, D is nearly empty, and E is empty.

Container A is **full**.

Container B is **nearly full**.

Container C is **half full**.

Container D is **nearly empty**.

Container E is **empty**.

A container that is 'half full'  
is also 'half empty'.

![Illustration of a smiling boy pointing to the text.](ca6278f97fabceafa65a476a2c9bf9c7_img.jpg)

Illustration of a smiling boy pointing to the text.

Try This!

Fill in the boxes with the words **full**, **nearly full**, **half full**, **nearly empty** or **empty**.

![Diagram showing a sequence of containers. Two containers are partially filled with water. A third container is being poured into the first container, which is then emptied. The final state shows two containers: one empty and one half full.](7a9216f98a56e85383d677a9cd1ba75c_img.jpg)

#### Comparing two containers

Smarty has a vase and a fish bowl. He fills up the vase with water. Then he pours all the water from the vase into the fish bowl as shown.

![Diagram showing water being poured from a vase into a fish bowl. The fish bowl is shown full, and the vase is empty, illustrating that the fish bowl holds more water than the vase.](3e5d006b56c58ff8b0162bc94dbdab8e_img.jpg)

Diagram showing water being poured from a vase into a fish bowl. The fish bowl is shown full, and the vase is empty, illustrating that the fish bowl holds more water than the vase.

The fish bowl can **hold more** water than the vase.  
We say that the fish bowl has a **larger capacity** than the vase.

We can also say that the vase can **hold less** water than the fish bowl.  
So, the vase has a **smaller capacity** than the fish bowl.

The **capacity** of a container is the measure of how much it can hold.

Try This!

Which container has the larger capacity?

![Container A: A large, round, light blue bowl.](cd8f187b8a8fcf7d2fc1a64de05c9061_img.jpg)

Look at the sizes of the containers.

![A cartoon robot holding a book.](cb0b81433e218b05e08f8897f56e6184_img.jpg)

A cartoon robot holding a book.

The trash bin can **hold the most**.  
It has the **largest capacity**.

The bottle can **hold the least**.  
It has the **smallest capacity**.

THINK!

If the difference in the capacities of the three containers cannot be easily seen, how can you find out which can hold the most or the least?

Try This!

Which container has the smallest capacity?

![Three containers labeled A, B, and C. A is a small orange bottle. B is a large blue water jug. C is a small brown jar.](ec091fa8aa9d476e3dad78488829606d_img.jpg)

#### **Materials needed (per group):**

- 2 containers — A & B
- water
- tray
- funnel (optional)

#### **Stop or splash!**

Get into groups of four.

Your teacher will give each group the materials you need.

1 Look at the two containers given. As a group, guess which container has a larger capacity. Put a tick () to show your guess in the table below.

|           | Container A | Container B |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Our guess |             |             |

2 Fill Container A completely with water.

3 Place Container B on the tray. Pour the water from Container A into Container B. Use the funnel if you need it.

Note: Stop pouring if Container B is full.

Do you know how to  
tell the time?

### I will learn to:

- Read time to the hour and half hour
- Order the days of the week and other familiar events

### Telling the time

A clock helps us to tell the time.

It has a **minute hand** and an **hour hand**.

The shorter hand is the **hour hand**.  
It shows us the hour.

![A clock face showing the hour hand pointing to 9 and the minute hand pointing to 12.](9525ab7edaab8eb7b55357f3e9d5a733_img.jpg)

A clock face showing the hour hand pointing to 9 and the minute hand pointing to 12.

The longer hand is the **minute hand**.  
It shows us the minutes.

When the minute hand is pointing to 12, we read the time as **o'clock**.  
'**O'clock**' stands for 'of the clock'.

The clock above shows the minute hand at 12 and the hour hand at 10. We say that the time is 10 o'clock.

![Illustration of a girl speaking.](d4e14dcb01748dc07ce857a39a542046_img.jpg)

Illustration of a girl speaking.

#### Try This!

Look at the clock on the right. Then fill in the missing numbers or words.

(a) The hand pointing at the number 4 is the  hand.

(b) The hand pointing at the number 12 is the  hand.

(c) The time is  o'clock.

A clock face showing the hour hand pointing to 10 and the minute hand pointing to 12.

When the minute hand is pointing to 6, we read the time as **half past**.

##### Materials needed (per pupil):

- paper plate
- marker
- thick coloured paper
- scissors
- fastener

1. Write the numbers 1 to 12 on the paper plate using the marker. First, write the numbers 3, 6, 9 and 12. Then fill in the other numbers.
2. Use the scissors to cut out a short arrow for the hour hand and a long arrow for the minute hand from the coloured paper.
3. Use the scissors to make a hole near the base of each arrow and in the middle of the plate.
4. Place the short arrow above the long arrow. Then put the fastener through the holes of the arrows and the plate, and secure it.

Your clock is done!

Use your clock to show your friend these times.

I have collected some items for recycling and presented the data in a table.

#### Items collected for recycling

| Type of items  | Number of items |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Used drink can | 5               |
| Used bottle    | 3               |
| Old newspaper  | 6               |

We can also show the data in the table above using a **pictogram**.

The **title** tells us what the pictogram is about.

## Problem-Solving

We can use these four steps to solve a problem.

### Step 1

#### Understand the problem

- What do I know?
- What do I need to find out?

### Step 2

#### Make a plan

- How can I solve the problem?

### Step 3

#### Try it out

- Does my plan work?
- Can I get the answer?

### Step 4

#### Look back

- How do I check my answer?

Let us look at some problems and learn how to solve them.

![A cartoon robot character holding a book, standing next to a speech bubble.](ec3a16906db567f3d2ac42395db23507_img.jpg)

Illustration of three children and two trees in a green landscape.

#### Example 1

There are five people in a room. If everyone shakes hands once with everyone else in the room, how many handshakes will take place in all?

Step 1

##### Understand the problem

- There are five people in the room.
- Each person shakes hands once with everyone else in the room.
- I need to find the total number of handshakes.

Step 2

#### Make a plan

I can draw a diagram.

Step 3

##### Try it out

![Diagram showing five people (represented by smiley faces) connected by lines, forming a pentagram shape.](4e0595fe58f30757d9559d67f566fbdd_img.jpg)

Diagram showing five people (represented by smiley faces) connected by lines, forming a pentagram shape.

Each line in this diagram stands for 1 handshake.

There are a total of 10 handshakes.

Step 4

#### Look back

Did each person shake hands once with everyone else in my diagram?

Did I count the number of lines correctly?

I can solve a problem  
by **drawing a diagram**.

##### Now, try this.

1. What is the least number of sticks we need to take away such that there are exactly 4 triangles left?

4 and 8, 5 and 7

**Method 2:** Draw a table.

|                           | 9                             | 11                            | 12                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| Possible pairs of numbers | 2 and 7<br>3 and 6<br>4 and 5 | 3 and 8<br>4 and 7<br>5 and 6 | 4 and 8<br>5 and 7 |

Since the cards cannot be repeated, we need to choose pairs that do not use the same numbers. Start by looking at the possible pairs that give 12, because it has fewer pairs than 9 and 11.

![Illustration of children playing outdoors with trees and a bench.](0d86fdf14c9466eff5b9ec87723b6fa1_img.jpg)

Illustration of children playing outdoors with trees and a bench.

The only possible pairs of cards are 2 and 7, 5 and 6 and 4 and 8.

The card with the number 3 is not used.

![Step 4 icon](a693cf2fc191aecedfb98fb9370c9bb2_img.jpg)

Step 4 icon

##### Look back

Are the sums of the three number pairs 9, 11 and 12?

Are the numbers in the number pairs used only once?

I can solve a problem by **making a list or drawing a table**.

##### Now, try this.

1. How many numbers can you make from the digits below? The numbers must be more than 5, but less than 20. Each digit can only be used once in each number.

![Cards showing the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9.](801be33d59eba649623077f36624b761_img.jpg)

Cards showing the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9.

1. The letters A, B and C can be put into different orders. For example, some possible orders are ABC and BCA. In how many ways can you arrange the three letters?

### Example 3

Tom uses 6 blocks to build this 3-step staircase. How many blocks are needed to build a 6-step staircase?

![Diagram showing a 3-step staircase built with 6 blocks.](af77b560611fb9a994ef4a95efc7f1ec_img.jpg)

Diagram showing a 3-step staircase built with 6 blocks.

#### Step 1

#### Understand the problem

I can see from the diagram:

- 1 block is used to build a 1-step staircase
- 3 blocks are used to build a 2-step staircase
- 6 blocks are used to build a 3-step staircase

I need to find out the number of blocks used to build a 6-step staircase.

#### Step 2

#### Make a plan

I can look for a pattern.

#### Step 3

#### Try it out

| Type of staircase | Number of blocks needed for the tallest column of steps | Total number of blocks needed |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1-step            | 1                                                       | 1                             |
| 2-step            | 2                                                       | 1 + 2 = 3                     |
| 3-step            | 3                                                       | 1 + 2 + 3 = 6                 |

The pattern: The number of blocks in the tallest column of steps increases by 1.

![Illustration of two children and trees in a park setting.](291b0b94467b068123da5b7c3d36fa65_img.jpg)

Illustration of two children and trees in a park setting.

We can continue the pattern to find the answer.

| Type of staircase | Number of blocks needed for the tallest column of steps | Total number of blocks needed |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1-step            | 1                                                       | 1                             |
| 2-step            | 2                                                       | $1 + 2 = 3$                   |
| 3-step            | 3                                                       | $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$               |
| 4-step            | 4                                                       | $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$          |
| 5-step            | 5                                                       | $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15$      |
| 6-step            | 6                                                       | $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$  |
